                <p>When you see this website, you will definitely see the phrase, "AWS Free Tier" first. This is the biggest phrase in this website. Then you wii see The second biggest phrase, "Gain free, hans-on..." Which is the description about AWS Free Tier, and you also have "Learn more about AWS Free Tier", but since this is not an important part compare to other information, the sentence has blue color which is close to the back ground color. At the last, you have "Create a Free Account" with yellow color. When we see red or yellow color, since those colors are stimulating colors, the will easily grab attention from users. In this case, since Amazon want us to use their services, the most important button is big and yellow and standing out. </p>
